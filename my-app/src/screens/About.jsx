      <p>We’ve approached the creation of this project as a means of creating a platform where crazy cat people and techies alike gather united in community around our core principals and the overall decentralization of wealth and governance at the individual level that a centralized initiative could never replicate. We are everything with this community, understanding we do indeed stand united in both purpose and control. From Day1, we’ve encouraged all individuals who love cats, cherish the sanctity of SoV, understand the value of Cobalt (Co), and those who stand for the power of The People to join what we call the “Cobalition”, the collective of all those who join our power-distributed community. Join the movement and drink your Cobaltinis in celebration of wealth and power!</p>
